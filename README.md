# BOUNCER

Bounce as many times as you can! But... don't fall down.

Compile the project with cmake by running these commands in the root folder of the repo.
(execute all commands from the directory this README is in, because otherwise the assets won't be loaded correctly)

```bash
$ cmake -B build
$ cmake --build build
```

Execute the project by running the compiled file:

```
($ chmod +x ./build/bin/Bouncer)
 $ ./build/bin/Bouncer
 ```

## Build

A build is included under ./prebuild compiled on macOS 15.3.1 (24D70) (Apple M2 Pro Chip, ARM-based) with cmake version 3.28.1.
(execute from root folder)
